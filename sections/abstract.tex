\section{Abstract}
In this project, we are proposing to solve algebraic word problems in a way similar to Kushman et al [cite Learning to Automatically Solve Algebra Word Problems]. However, rather than relying on a rule based approach [look at above paper for citations to rule based approaches], or a mapping function to a set of templates (as in Kushman et al), we are proposing a slightly different method. In this method, we will learn a mapping from the input sequence of words, to a set of triples of potential expressions, via a dependency parse of the text. Then, rather than mapping each entity or verb in the text to a template, we will map each element in the triple to a type in our language, based on a probabilistic model.
Finally, our programming language will be implemented to solve the expressions provided by our NLP model, based on a simple operational semantics we have created for solving such problems. The target language will be the simple \IMP language.

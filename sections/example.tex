\section{Example}
\begin{problem}
	Pooja has 3 apples. She eats one apple. How many apples does Pooja have now?
\end{problem}
We attempt to translate the sample problem's text into the following commands:
\[\begin{array}{lrcllL}
\textit{Pooja has 3 apples} & -> & \setc{a_p}{3}
\\
\textit{She eats one apple} & -> & \setc{a_p}{a_p - 1}
\\
\textit{How many apples does Pooja have now?} & -> & \printc{a_p}
\end{array}\]
And since these are sequence of steps we end up with:
\[
	\seqc{\setc{a_p}{3}}{\seqc{\setc{a_p}{\minusc{a_p}{1}}}{\printc{a_p}}}
\]
More formally:
\[
\seqa{\seta{a_p}{3}}{\seqa{\seta{a_p}{\minusa{a_p}{1}}}{\printa{a_p}}}
\]
